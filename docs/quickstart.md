## Installing the Blinks Library

After you have installed the Arduino IDE (> 1.8.5) and launched the application, you will notice that Arduino has created a folder in your `Documents` folder, aptly named, `Arduino`. Follow these next 5 steps to have the Blinks library installed:


1. Create a folder called `hardware` inside of the Arduino folder `~/Documents/Arduino/hardware` (it will be next to ‚Äòlibraries‚Äô, not nested inside) and one more called `Move38-Blinks-Library` inside of the hardware folder you just created. `~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/Move38-Blinks-Library`
2. Download the Blinks Library if you haven‚Äôt already done so
3. Unzip the Blinks Library into a folder called `avr`
5. Move the Blinks Library into the `Move38-Blinks-Library` folder (the path will be `~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/Move38-Blinks-Library/avr/`)
6. Restart Arduino (quit and relaunch)

If you click on `Tools` in your menu bar, and navigate down to `Board:`  you should now see `Move38: Blinks Tile` at the bottom. Select it.

Next, click on  `Tools` in your menu bar, and navigate down to `Programmer:`  select the programmer `USBTinyISP` or see below for faster upload time with `Blinks Programmer`

Now if you go to `File/Examples`, you should see Examples for Blinks Tiles at the bottom of that list as well. Open the first one up and see if it compiles.



## Transfer code to Blink

![Image of Transferring Blink Code](assets/transfercode.jpeg)

1. Connect the USB programmer
2. Place the magnetic programming jig on top of the Blink
3. Press `Upload` to transfer

Not successfully transferring to your Blinks? try these [troubleshooting tips from the forum](http://forum.move38.com/t/error-the-selected-serial-port-does-not-exist-or-your-board-is-not-connected/79/3?u=jbobrow)


## Windows Troubleshooting

No programmer detected?
Check to make sure you have the correct [driver installed](https://learn.adafruit.com/usbtinyisp/drivers), relaunch the Ardunio IDE and then you should be able to select USBTinyISP from the Tools > Programmer drop-down in Arduino.

For the extra curious, here is the [source code](https://github.com/sparkfun/Pocket_AVR_Programmer/tree/master/Drivers) for that driver.


## *Faster Upload Time
1. Download [this](https://move38.com/attic/blinks/programmers.txt) file (right click and save link as)
2. Move file to `/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/arduino/avr` (it will replace the existing file here)
3. Restart Arduino if it was open
4. Now select the `Blinks Programmer` when programming and it should be roughly 4x faster upload speeds ‚ö°

## Sharing Code with Other Blinks

Rather than using the above method method to transfer code to a tile one-by-one, a Blink that has already been programmed can share it's sketch with neighboring tiles.  This will save a lot of time when ptototyping your own games and programs.

1. Ensure the programmed tile is alone, seperated from the other tiles.
2. Press and hold the tile's button for **6 seconds**, until the tile "glitters" blue.
3. Connect this tile to the others that you want to share the game with.

As long as all connected tiles are either awake or in a "warm sleep", each tile will establish a link between one of it's neighbors, and all tiles will share the original sketch simultaneously.  *In order for this feature to function properly, please make sure all blinks have the lastest [firmware release](https://github.com/Move38/Blinks-SDK/releases).*


## Using the Blinks Service Port to talk to or listen to your Blink

The Service Port is by no means necessary, but is a phenomenal tool for debugging code and refining early sketches into robust games. The following steps show you how to use your Blinks Service Port.

1. Put together the components of your Blinks Service port so they look like this
  1. USB Cable ‚Üí FTDI ‚Üí Blinks Serial Adapter ‚Üí Molex Cable ‚Üí Blink (w/ Serial port)
  2. <photo of the above>
2. Open Arduino
3. click on `Tools` in your menu bar, and navigate down to `Port:`  you should now see `COM3` on a PC and `/dev/cu...` on a Mac. Select it.
4. press the magnifying glass in the top right corner of the Arduino IDE to open the Serial Monitor

Note: The serial port is at a fixed 1,000,000 baud rate (set it in the drop-down).

To write to the Serial port from a sketch,

1. Add ‚Äú#include Serial.h‚Äù
2. Instantiate a ServicePortSerial class, like this `ServicePortSerial sp`
3. Call the begin method within setup(), like this `sp.begin()`

Here is the simplest of ServicePort sketches:
